  Work with one more possibility for *local* packages in latest Meteor.

  since our API has supported that now for a while.

  @DSpeichert, @matteosaporiti

## v0.0.33

Meteor shark branch (block helpers and raw HTML are working now),

`websiteUI` directories.*  Note, iron-router for UI is not stable
yet.

* Updated `meteor-headers` dep to v0.0.15

## v0.0.19

when `mf_extract_wrapper` calls `mf_extract.js`, it will be
available in the packages directory (#14).

* Correctly compile text on the server (#12)

* Remove unnecessary debug console.log's (#13)

## v0.0.18

output.  The current version, project dir, and each parsed string.
