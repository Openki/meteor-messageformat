# meteor-messageformat

MessageFormat support, the Meteor way.

Please choose the appropriate branch:

* `v0` - stable, frozen, discontinued aside from critical bugs and security issues.
* `v2` - in development, approaching stable (but already used in production), new
  features, fixes, etc.  See README *before* upgrading.

For full info, docs and examples, see the
[Meteor MessageFormat home page](http://messageformat.meteor.com/)
(or install/clone the smart package and run `meteor` in its `website` directory).
